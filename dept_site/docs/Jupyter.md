Here are some handy keyboard shortcuts:

* Run a cell with `Cmd + Enter`. Use `Shift + Enter` to run a cell and advance to the next one
* Use tab-completion to complete variable names (technically an iPython keyboard shortcut)
* Use shift-tab-completion to see what methods are available to a Python object, for example: `df.<Shift+Tab>` will pull up a dropdown menu of available methods (also technically an iPython shortcut)
* When a cell is selected press `A` to create a new cell above or B to create a new cell below
* When a cell is selected press `C` to copy that cell or X to cut that cell and then `V` to paste it
* Use `Z` to undo the cutting of a cell
